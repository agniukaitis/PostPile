About developer
---------------
My name is Julius Semenas, and I am a researcher, currently working on advanced prostate cancer and its treatments. I have recently received a Master degree in Biomedicine, and am currently on the way to start a PhD in Biomedicine, at Lund Unversity.


Apart from the researcher, I take great interest in programming. Currently, I am developing my own web application, which is meant to improve everyday routines in the lab. I am constantly looking for poeple to join my project, and hope that one day this wonderful app will see the daylight.


I have gather basic knowledge in web page development. However, it is not nearly enought to create a sophisticated web app. Herewith, to keep myself up to dated and master my programming skills, I have decied to enroll in this course at BTH. This course is one of several distance courses I have taken over the year, throughout the whole of Sweden.


Basic HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and database knowledge is indeed very important elements of any modern web page. In this context, I feel like this course goes one step further, and combines the aforementioned elements. In my eyes, it is the best way to learn how to build a proper web page.
